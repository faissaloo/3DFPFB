#3DFPFB
3DFPFB stands for 3-Dimensional First Person File Browser. Long story short, it turns whatever folder you start it in into a world that you can walk around and explore. I may turn it into a full blown file browser (when this issue gets sorted: https://github.com/enigma-dev/enigma-dev/issues/947).

This is based on Mark Overmans' 3D FPS example.

To compile it you will need either the Enigma Compiler or Game Maker:Studio (I have not tried compiling it on Studio but it should work). The precompiled binary should work though.
